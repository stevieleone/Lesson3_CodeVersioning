            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a developer's best friend. It is a way to save all versions of data, files, pictures and anything else a user is developing.It saves different verions of each file so that the developer is able to revert back and use past versions, restart from older versions or even just reassess. There are three types of version control systems: local, centralized and distributed. A local system is for a user to save their versions on their own computer for their own use. A centralized system helped expand the use of version control systems because it makes it possible for a file on one single server, to be checked out by other clients. This makes it possible to collaborate and share. Finally the distributed system mirrors another repository, so that if a server ever went down, there are back ups from the existing clients that were collaborating on that clients file.  </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Repositories</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository is the organized bin of data and files that stores all versions that have been created. There are two types of repositories: remote and local. A remote repository is stored on a remote server where it can be accessed by other users besides the developer. The local respository resides on a local machine where only one individual can access that bin of data and files. Repositories can come to exist in two ways. First one can be made entirely new with a fresh bunch of data or a repository can be cloned from an already existing repository. Cloning a repository can then give multiple versions of the same file depending on which client server is using it.  </p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a specific type of distributed version control system. Git creates a way for the user to have a copy of the repository on their machine but also have it able to be accessed by a distributed version.Git will also never allow an overwrite, so your data and files are kept exactly as the user intended.This version control is user-friendly and creates a faster processing time. It creates a simple way to control the repository by using git commands. These commands make it possible to add, commit and push your data and files to your repository where they can be stored as seperate commits.  </p>
